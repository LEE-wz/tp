# HuntR User Guide

HuntR is a **desktop application for a sole HR administrator to manage employee records, optimised for use through a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type quickly, HuntR can help you add, find, update and remove employee records faster than traditional GUI-based HR tools.

HuntR is based on [AddressBook-Level3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3) from SE-EDU. This guide covers version 1.5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure that Java `25` or later is installed on your computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `huntr.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-W10-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for HuntR.

1. Open a terminal, `cd` to the folder containing the JAR file, and run `java -jar huntr.jar`.<br>
   A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. For example, type **`help`** and press Enter to open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all active employees.

   * `sort department` : Sorts the displayed employees by department, from A to Z.

   * `add id/E0123 n/John Tan p/91234567 e/johntan@example.com d/Engineering r/Software Engineer` : Adds an employee named `John Tan` to HuntR.

   * `edit id/E0123 p/92345678 r/Senior Software Engineer` : Updates the phone number and role of employee `E0123`.

   * `find Alex` : Finds employees whose names contain the word `Alex`.

   * `filter d/Engineering r/Manager` : Shows only the employees in the Engineering department whose role contains `Manager`.

   * `delete id/E0123` : Deletes employee `E0123`, including when hidden by a search.

   * `clear` : Deletes all active employees while preserving archived records.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  For example, in `add id/EMPLOYEE_ID n/NAME`, replace `EMPLOYEE_ID` and `NAME` with values such as `E0123` and `John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  For example, `edit id/EMPLOYEE_ID [p/PHONE]` can be used as `edit id/E0001 p/91234567`.

* Command words are written in lowercase, for example `list` and `filter`; `List` is not a command. The same is true for `archived` in `list archived`. If you mistype a command word, HuntR suggests the closest command, for example `Did you mean filter?` for `fliter`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  For example, if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for `help` and `clear` are ignored.<br>
  For example, `help 123` is interpreted as `help`. The `backup` and `exit` commands also take no parameters but reject extra text, so `backup now` and `exit now` show an error. Likewise, `list` accepts only `archived` after it, so `list 1` shows an error.
  The `stats` and `check` commands take no parameters and reject extra text too.

* When `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `archive` or `unarchive` succeeds, the result message shows the employee's details.
  It ends with `; Manager: MANAGER_ID` if the employee has a manager.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</box>

### Typing commands faster

These keys work in the command box:

| Key | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>↑</kbd> | Brings back the command you typed before. Press it again to go further back. |
| <kbd>↓</kbd> | Goes forward again. After the newest command, it shows what you had been typing. |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> | Completes the command word. `fil` becomes `filter `. When several commands start with what you typed, it completes as far as they are the same, so `u` becomes `un` (`undo`, `unarchive` and `unassign-manager`). |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Clears the command box. |

* The commands you typed are kept until you close HuntR. Up to 100 are kept, and a command that gave an error is kept too, so you can bring it back and correct it.
* A command that is the same as the one before it is kept once.
* <kbd>Tab</kbd> only completes the first word, so it does nothing once you have typed a space. <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> still moves between parts of the window.

### Viewing help: `help`

Opens a help window that lists the format of every command and links to this user guide.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

* Click **Copy URL** to copy the link to this user guide.
* You can also open the help window by pressing <kbd>F1</kbd> or choosing **Help** in the menu bar.


### Adding an employee: `add`

Adds a new active employee to HuntR.

Format: `add id/EMPLOYEE_ID n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL d/DEPARTMENT r/ROLE [m/MANAGER_ID]`

Supply each of the six required fields exactly once, with a non-blank value. Parameters can be supplied in any
order. Prefixes are case-sensitive: use `id/`, not `ID/`. Repeated prefixes (including `m/`), unknown parameters
such as `x/`, and extra text before the first parameter are rejected. Separate each parameter from the preceding
value with a space.

| Field | Accepted values |
| --- | --- |
| `id/EMPLOYEE_ID` | 1 to 20 characters: English letters, digits, hyphens and underscores. IDs are compared case-insensitively. |
| `n/NAME` | Must start with a letter or digit. May contain letters (including accented and non-Latin letters), combining marks, digits, spaces and the symbols `'` `.` `,` `/` `-`, for example `Mary-Ann O'Brien` or `Ravi s/o Kumar`. |
| `p/PHONE` | At least 3 digits in total. May contain spaces and the symbols `+` `-` `,` `.` and brackets, for example `+65 6123-4567 (HP)`. English letter labels are allowed only inside brackets. Brackets must be balanced, non-empty and not nested. |
| `e/EMAIL` | An address such as `john.tan@example.com`. The part before `@` uses letters and digits, with `+` `_` `.` `-` between alphanumeric groups. Domain labels use letters and digits with internal hyphens; the final label has at least 2 characters. |
| `d/DEPARTMENT`, `r/ROLE` | Must start with a letter or digit. May contain letters (including accented and non-Latin letters), combining marks, digits, spaces and the symbols `&` `'` `(` `)` `,` `.` `-`, up to 100 characters after normalisation. |
| `m/MANAGER_ID` (optional) | An existing employee's ID, matched case-insensitively and saved using the spelling of the existing ID. An empty value, unknown manager or self-assignment is rejected. Omit the parameter to add an employee without a manager. |

Leading and trailing spaces are removed from field values. Repeated spaces inside names, departments and roles
are reduced to one space, so `n/John  Tan` is saved as `John Tan` and `d/Human  Resources` as `Human Resources`.
Department and role normalisation also applies to `edit`, `import` and values loaded when HuntR starts.

**After a successful add:** HuntR displays `New employee added:` followed by the employee's details and shows all
active employees, including the new record. This clears the previous search, filter or archived view.
The change is saved automatically. If saving fails, HuntR reports the save error and restores the previous records
and view; the addition has not succeeded.

**If the ID is already used:** HuntR rejects the addition even when the existing employee is hidden by the current
view. For example, if active employee `E0123` exists, adding `id/e0123` displays
`An employee with Employee ID e0123 already exists.` Archived employees also reserve their IDs: in that case,
the message is ``An employee with Employee ID e0123 already exists in the archive. Use `list archived` to see it.``
Use `list archived` to inspect the record and `unarchive id/E0123` if you intended to restore that employee.

**If the name matches another employee:** HuntR still adds the employee, then displays a warning. Matching ignores
letter case and extra spaces, and treats equivalent ways of typing a Unicode accent as the same letter.
It does not ignore accents or punctuation, correct spelling, or reorder words: `José Tan` and `JOSÉ Tan` match,
but `Jose Tan` and `José Tan`, or `Mary-Ann` and `Mary Ann`, do not.

Both active and archived employees are checked regardless of the current view. The warning lists up to five
matching IDs in their saved roster order, marking archived matches `(archived)`. If more than five match,
it also gives the total number of existing matches. The new employee is excluded from this count.
Existing records remain unchanged. Check the listed IDs before deciding whether the new record is intentional.
Use `find NAME` for active matches and `list archived` to inspect archived matches; the warning does not prevent duplicates
with different IDs.

Examples (use IDs that are not already stored):

* `add id/E0123 n/John Tan p/91234567 e/johntan@example.com d/Engineering r/Software Engineer`
* `add id/EMP-0042 n/Nur Aisyah p/87654321 e/nur.aisyah@example.com d/Human Resources r/HR Executive`
* `add id/2024-017 n/Marcus Lee p/90001111 e/marcus.lee@example.com d/Finance r/Accountant`
* After adding `E0123`, `add id/E0124 n/Mei Lim p/81234567 e/mei.lim@example.com d/Engineering r/Developer m/e0123`
  assigns `E0123` as Mei's manager. The success message ends with `; Manager: E0123`.

### Listing all active employees: `list`

Shows all active employees stored in HuntR as a numbered list. Archived employees are excluded.
Each card shows the employee's name, employee ID, phone number, email, department, role and manager
(`Reports to MANAGER_ID` or `Unassigned`). Scroll the employee panel to see records below the visible area;
hover over shortened details to see their full values.

Format: `list`

Example: `list`

Use `list` without arguments to show active employees, or [`list archived`](#listing-archived-employees-list-archived)
to show archived employees. Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored. Both the command word `list` and the
optional argument `archived` must be lowercase.

* Replaces the current search, filter, archived-only or reporting view with **all active employees**.
* Resets any `sort` to the stored roster order, normally the order employees were added or imported.
  It does not change the saved order or any employee's details.
* The numbers on the cards (`01`, `02` and so on) start at `01` for the current view and may change when the view changes.
  Use the employee ID, such as `E0001`, to identify an employee in commands that require `id/`.
* Does not save employee data or add an undo step, and preserves any available redo. `undo` reverses the last
  employee-data change while keeping the current view; it does not bring back the search or sorting cleared by `list`.

The result depends on the records stored:

| Roster state | Result |
| --- | --- |
| At least one active employee | Shows all active cards and `Listed all active employees.` |
| Only archived employees remain | Shows an empty active panel and suggests `list archived`, with the number of archived employees. |
| No active or archived employees | Shows an empty panel and the guidance below. |

```text
You don’t have any employees yet.
Add employees by using
add id/EMPLOYEE_ID n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL d/DEPARTMENT r/ROLE
to get a start!
```

For example, if two archived employees are the only remaining records, `list` displays:

```text
There are no active employees. Use `list archived` to see the 2 archived employees.
```

Arguments such as `list 1`, `list all`, `list d/Engineering`, `list ARCHIVED` and `list archived extra` are rejected
with `Invalid command format.` followed by `Usage: list [archived]`. The previous view and sorting remain unchanged.
Use [`filter`](#filtering-employees-filter) to narrow the roster by employee details.

Examples:

* `find Alex`, then `list`: shows every active employee again, including those hidden by the search.
* `sort id desc`, then `list`: restores the stored roster order.
* `list archived`, then `list`: returns to the active roster.

The following example contains two active employees and one archived employee. `list` shows the active employees
in their stored order, with their manager information:

![Listing all active employees in stored order](images/list-active-employees.jpg)

After all three employees are archived, the active panel is empty and `list` gives their archived count:

![Empty active list with a hint to view the three archived employees](images/list-no-active-employees.jpg)

### Editing an employee: `edit`

Edits an existing employee in HuntR using their employee ID.

Format: `edit id/EMPLOYEE_ID [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [d/DEPARTMENT] [r/ROLE] [m/MANAGER_ID]`

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* Use `m/MANAGER_ID` to change the manager, or an empty `m/` to remove the manager. Omitting `m/` preserves it.
* For example, `edit id/E0002 m/E0001` assigns manager `E0001`, and `edit id/E0002 m/` removes that assignment.
* The result message ends with `; Manager: MANAGER_ID` when the edited employee has a manager, so you can confirm
  a manager change without looking at the list.
* The manager must exist in the complete roster. Self-reporting and reporting cycles are rejected without changes.
* Editing an archived employee preserves their archived status.
* The `id/` parameter identifies the employee to edit. The employee ID itself cannot be changed.
* Employee ID matching is case-insensitive: `edit id/e0001 ...` identifies employee `E0001`.
* HuntR searches the complete employee roster, so an employee hidden by the current `find` result can still be edited.
* After a successful edit, HuntR resets the list to show all active employees, clearing any active `find` result.
* If every value you give is the same as the employee's current value, HuntR displays
  `No changes made: the new values are the same as the existing ones for E0001.` and nothing is saved or added to
  the `undo` history. Changing only the letter case of a name, such as `carol ng` to `Carol Ng`, counts as a change.
* If an employee ID such as `E9999` does not exist, HuntR displays `No employee with ID E9999 was found.` and does not change any records.

Examples:
* `edit id/E0001 p/91234567 e/alex@example.com` updates the phone number and email address of employee `E0001`.
* `edit id/e0002 r/HR Manager` updates the role of employee `E0002`, using case-insensitive ID matching.

### Assigning a manager: `manager`

Assigns or changes an employee's direct manager using the complete roster, including employees hidden by a search.
Each employee can have at most one direct manager. Assigning a manager preserves all other employee details,
including archived status. The employee card shows the manager's ID, or `Unassigned` when no manager is set.

Format: `manager id/EMPLOYEE_ID m/MANAGER_ID`

Example: `manager id/E0002 m/E0001` makes employee `E0002` report to `E0001`.

Both IDs must exist. Matching ignores case and saved manager IDs and success messages use the roster's ID spelling.
On success, HuntR displays `Manager of E0002 set to E0001.` for the example above.

The following errors leave all records unchanged. These messages do not include a usage block. Assume `E0001`,
`E0002` and `E0003` exist, and `E9999` does not exist. The cycle example additionally assumes that `E0002` reports
to `E0001`, and `E0003` reports to `E0002`.

| Input | Error message |
| --- | --- |
| `manager id/E0001 m/E0001` (self-reporting) | `An employee cannot report to themselves.` |
| `manager id/E0001 m/E9999` (unknown manager) | `Manager does not exist: E9999` |
| `manager id/E9999 m/E0001` (unknown employee) | `No employee with ID E9999 was found.` |
| `manager id/E0001 m/E0003` (reporting cycle) | `Reporting relationships cannot contain a cycle.` |

These manager validation messages also apply to `add` and `edit` when assigning a manager. See
[Reporting command input rules](#reporting-command-input-rules) for malformed arguments.

### Removing a manager: `unassign-manager`

Removes an employee's direct manager. The employee and their own reports remain in the roster.

Format: `unassign-manager id/EMPLOYEE_ID`

Example: `unassign-manager id/E0002`. Equivalently, use `edit id/E0002 m/`.

On success, HuntR displays `Manager of E0002 unassigned.`. An employee who already has no manager remains unchanged,
and the command still succeeds. `unassign-manager id/E9999` produces `No employee with ID E9999 was found.` if
`E9999` does not exist; no records change.

### Viewing an employee's team: `team`

Shows the employee, their direct manager (if assigned), and their direct reports. The result message gives the
manager's name and ID (or `None`) and the number of direct reports. Indirect reports are excluded.

Format: `team id/EMPLOYEE_ID`

Example: `team id/E0002`. After `manager id/E0002 m/E0001` and `manager id/E0003 m/E0002`,
this shows `E0001`, `E0002` and `E0003`, and reports one direct report for `E0002`.
An employee with no manager and no reports is shown on their own with a direct-report count of zero.

### Viewing all reports: `org`

Shows all direct and indirect reports under the specified employee. The employee themselves is excluded.
The result message lists descendants in breadth-first order. Employee cards preserve the current sort order,
or roster order when no sort is active. For example, after `sort id desc`, the cards remain sorted by descending ID.

Format: `org id/EMPLOYEE_ID`

Example: `org id/E0001`. With `E0002` reporting to `E0001` and `E0003` reporting to `E0002`,
the result includes `E0002` and `E0003`. With no reports, the list is empty and the message says `None.`

### Viewing the reporting chain: `chain`

Shows the specified employee's managers, from their immediate manager to the top of the hierarchy.
The employee themselves is excluded. The result message shows chain order using `->`. Employee cards preserve
the current sort order, or roster order when no sort is active.

Format: `chain id/EMPLOYEE_ID`

Example: `chain id/E0003`. With `E0003` reporting to `E0002` and `E0002` reporting to `E0001`,
the message lists `E0002 -> E0001` (with their names). With no manager, the list is empty and the message says `None.`

### Reporting command input rules

For `manager`, `unassign-manager`, `team`, `org` and `chain`, IDs must contain 1 to 20 letters, digits, hyphens or
underscores. Supply exactly one `id/` parameter. Only `manager` also accepts (and requires) one `m/` parameter.
Parameters can be in either order, with surrounding whitespace ignored. A blank manager is rejected by `manager`;
use `unassign-manager` or `edit id/EMPLOYEE_ID m/` to remove an assignment.

The following table gives the error text before the command-specific usage block. Each error leaves records and
the current list unchanged. These examples use `team`; the equivalent malformed arguments on the other reporting
commands append those commands' own usage instead.

| Input | Error message before usage |
| --- | --- |
| `team` (missing ID) | `Invalid command format.` |
| `team id/` (blank ID) | `Employee ID should not be blank.` |
| `team id/@@@` or `team id/E0001 extra` | `Employee ID should be 1 to 20 characters long and contain only letters, digits, hyphens and underscores.` |
| `team id/ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU` (21 characters) | `Employee ID should be at most 20 characters long.` |
| `team id/E0001 id/E0002` | `Multiple values specified for the following single-valued field(s): id/` |
| `team extra id/E0001` | `Invalid command format.` |
| `team id/E0001 x/foo` | `Invalid command format.` followed by `Unknown parameter: x/` |
| `manager id/E0001` (missing manager) | `Invalid command format.` |
| `manager id/E0001 m/` (blank manager) | `Employee ID should not be blank.` |

For example, entering `team` displays:

```text
Invalid command format.
team: Shows an employee, their manager and direct reports.
Parameters: id/EMPLOYEE_ID
Example: team id/E0002
```

A valid but unknown target ID produces `No employee with ID E9999 was found.` for `id/E9999`, without usage.
This applies to `team`, `org`, `chain` and `unassign-manager` as well as `manager`. It leaves records and the current
list unchanged.

Reporting queries replace the current search filter and leave records unchanged. They query relationships across
the complete stored roster. Related archived employees are included in both the messages and employee cards,
so report counts and named managers agree with the displayed results. The current sort order is preserved. While a
reporting result remains displayed, relationship changes, deletion, undo and redo refresh it to match the current
reporting structure.
Use `list` to return to all active employees, or `list archived` to show only archived employees.

Reporting relationships are also preserved by CSV export and import. `export file/FILE_PATH` writes the header
`id,name,phone,email,department,role,archived,managerId`; a blank `managerId` means no manager. For example,
use `export file/exports/staff.csv` and then `import file/exports/staff.csv` into an empty roster. Import accepts the older
six-column format and seven-column format ending in `archived`, treating those rows as having no manager.
A manager may appear later in the file or already exist in HuntR. Invalid IDs, missing managers, self-reporting
and cycles reject the import without adding any employees. Existing employee IDs are rejected rather than overwritten.

Quoted CSV fields may span multiple physical lines, including files using LF or CRLF line endings. For example,
a quoted name containing `Alice` and `Smith` on separate lines is normalised to `Alice Smith`. Complete field values
still follow the usual validation rules. An actually unclosed quoted field is rejected. Import errors identify the
physical line where the record starts, counting the header as line 1; a multiline record counts as one employee.

### Finding employees by name: `find`

Finds employees whose names contain any of the given keywords and displays them in the employee list.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive and ignores accents; for example, `hans` matches `Hans`, and `emile` matches `Émile`.
* Keyword order does not matter; for example, `Hans Bo` matches `Bo Hans`.
* The search considers only names.
* Only full words match; for example, `Han` does not match `Hans`.
* Spaces and punctuation separate the words of a name, so `Tan` matches `Tan, Ah Kow` and `Dr. John Tan Jr.`, `Mary` and `Ann` match `Mary-Ann O'Brien`, and `s/o` matches `Ravi s/o Kumar`. The apostrophe is part of a word, so use `O'Brien`; `Brien` does not match `O'Brien`.
* A keyword that contains punctuation, such as `Mary-Ann`, matches when all of its words are in the name. A comma after a keyword is ignored, so `find Ah, Mary-Ann` is the same as `find Ah Mary-Ann`.
* Employees matching at least one keyword are returned (an `OR` search); for example, `Hans Bo` returns `Hans Gruber` and `Bo Yang`.
* At least one non-blank keyword must be provided.
* Each keyword must start with a letter or digit. Apostrophes, full stops, commas, slashes and hyphens are allowed
  after the first character. If a keyword is not valid, the message names it, for example `Invalid keyword: @bo`.
* An argument beginning with `/` is rejected as an invalid command format.
* A search with no matching name is still valid.
* Leading and trailing spaces are ignored, and multiple spaces between keywords are treated as separators. Any kind of
  space separates keywords, including the non-breaking space that is copied from a web page.
* A search with no matches is successful and displays an empty employee list.

Examples:
* `find John` returns employees named `john` and `John Doe`
* `find Tan` returns `Tan, Ah Kow` and `Dr. John Tan Jr.`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  ![result for 'find alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)

### Viewing workforce statistics: `stats`

Shows the total number of active employees and the employee counts for each department and role in the result box.

Format: `stats`

* Counts cover all active employees, including employees hidden by a search. Archived employees are excluded,
  even when `list archived` is currently displayed.
* Each breakdown is sorted by count, largest first. Ties are sorted by department or role name in the same order
  as `sort`: alphabetical, ignoring letter case and accents, with numbers compared by value (`apple`, `Banana`,
  `Émile`, `Level 2`, `Level 10`). Names that differ only in case, such as `Ops` and `ops`, list the uppercase one
  first.
* Department and role names are grouped exactly as stored: `Ops` and `ops` are separate groups.
* The employee records and current employee list view are unchanged.
* If there are no active employees, the total is `0` and both breakdowns display `(none)`.

Example: `stats`, with two active employees in Ops and one in Sales, displays:

```text
Total active employees: 3
By department:
Ops: 2
Sales: 1
By role:
Engineer: 2
Manager: 1
```

The command accepts leading and trailing spaces but no arguments. For example, `stats d/Ops` and `stats 1`
are rejected with `Invalid command format.` followed by `Usage: stats`. No records or list filters change.

### Checking data quality: `check`

Lists active employees who share a phone number or email with another active employee in the result box.
Shared contact details may indicate a data-entry error; HuntR flags them for review without editing or deleting them.

Format: `check`

* Checks cover all active employees regardless of the current search or archive view. Archived employees neither
  appear in the report nor cause an active employee to be flagged.
* Phone numbers are compared exactly as stored, so `91234567` and `9123 4567` are different.
* Emails are compared ignoring letter case, since they reach the same inbox. For example, `Alice@example.com`
  and `alice@example.com` are flagged as a shared email, and each entry shows the email as stored.
* Every affected employee is counted and listed once, even if both their phone and email are shared or more
  than two employees share a value. Each entry includes their ID, name and shared contact details.
* Entries are sorted by employee ID, ignoring letter case. The current employee list view and records are unchanged.
* An empty active roster or a roster without shared contacts produces `No data-quality issues found.`

Example: if active employees E0001 (Alice) and E0002 (Bob) both have phone number `91234567`, `check` displays:

```text
Found 2 active employee(s) with data-quality issues:
E0001 (Alice): shared phone 91234567
E0002 (Bob): shared phone 91234567
```

Use `edit id/EMPLOYEE_ID ...` to correct a record after reviewing it, then run `check` again.

The command accepts leading and trailing spaces but no arguments. For example, `check id/E0001` and `check all`
are rejected with `Invalid command format.` followed by `Usage: check`. No records or list filters change.

### Filtering employees: `filter`

Shows only the employees who match the employee ID, name, department and role that you give.

Format: `filter [id/EMPLOYEE_ID] [n/NAME] [d/DEPARTMENT] [r/ROLE]`

* At least one of `id/`, `n/`, `d/` or `r/` must be given. If you give several, an employee must match **all** of them (an `AND` search), so the list is narrowed further.
* Matching is case-insensitive and uses whole words, like `find`. For example, `d/engineering` matches `Engineering`, and `d/Resources` matches `Human Resources`, but `d/Engineer` does not match `Engineering`. Unicode case variants also match: `n/YILMAZ` matches `Yılmaz`, and `d/οσ` matches `ΟΣ`.
* Spaces and punctuation separate words. For example, `d/R&D` matches the department `R&D, Asia`, and `r/Backend` or `r/(Backend)` matches the role `Software Engineer (Backend)`. The symbols `&` and `'` stay part of a word.
* If a value has several words, every word must appear in that field, in any order. For example, `r/Software Engineer` matches `Software Engineer` but not `Software Manager`.
* An employee ID must be the whole ID, such as `id/E0123`. The ID is not case-sensitive.
* To match any of several values of the same field (an `OR` search), repeat the prefix. For example, `d/Sales d/Finance` matches employees in `Sales` or in `Finance`. Each repeated value is a separate search, so `r/Manager r/Analyst` is not the same as `r/Manager Analyst`, which needs both words.
* A new `filter` replaces the earlier `find` or `filter`. They are not combined, so to narrow the list further, put all the fields in one `filter`.
* Filtering only changes what is shown. Your saved data is not changed. Archived employees are not shown. Use [`list`](#listing-all-active-employees-list) to show all active employees again.
* The order set by [`sort`](#sorting-employees-sort) is kept, so you can filter and sort in any order.
* A filter with no matches is valid and shows an empty list with the message `0 employees listed!`.
* Leading and trailing spaces are ignored, and the parameters can be in any order.

Examples:
* `filter d/Engineering` shows everyone in the Engineering department.
* `filter r/Manager` shows employees whose role contains the word `Manager`, such as `Engineering Manager`.
* `filter d/Engineering r/Manager` shows only the Engineering employees whose role contains `Manager`.
* `filter n/John d/Sales` shows only the employees named `John` who are in Sales. Other people in Sales, and Johns in other departments, are not shown.
* `filter d/Sales d/Finance r/Manager` shows the managers who are in Sales or in Finance.
* `filter id/E0123` shows only the employee with the ID `E0123`.

Tip: `filter d/Engineering` followed by `sort name` shows the Engineering employees in alphabetical order.

The following input errors leave the displayed list unchanged. Each message is followed by the usage of the command.

| Input | Error message |
| --- | --- |
| `filter` or `filter Engineering` | `Invalid command format.` |
| `filter e/john@example.com` or `filter x/foo` | `Invalid command format.` followed by `Unknown parameter: e/` (or the parameter given) |
| `filter d/` or `filter n/` | `The value of d/ should contain at least one letter or digit.` (or `n/`, `r/`) |
| `filter d/@@@` | `The value of d/ should contain at least one letter or digit.` |
| `filter id/E 1` | The employee ID constraints message |

Some symbol-only values are accepted instead of showing the validation error above;
see [Known issues](#known-issues) for the limitation and workaround.

### Archiving employees: `archive`

Marks an active employee as archived. Archived employees remain stored but are hidden from normal `list`, `find`
and `filter` results and excluded from `stats` and `check`.
The current list, search or filter and sort order are preserved. The employee disappears from active-only views;
other matching employees stay visible. Use `list archived` to see the archived record.

Format: `archive id/EMPLOYEE_ID`

Example: `archive id/E0123`

* Supply exactly one `id/` parameter. The ID must contain 1 to 20 letters, digits, hyphens or underscores,
  with no spaces. Matching ignores letter case, so `archive id/e0123` also finds `E0123`.
* The employee need not be visible: the command searches all stored records, even from an empty search or archive view.
* The employee keeps their ID, contact details, department, role and reporting relationships. Their ID remains
  reserved, so archiving does not let you add another employee with that ID.
* Successful archiving is saved automatically. Use `undo` or `redo` during the same session to reverse or repeat it;
  the archived status survives a restart, while undo history does not.

On success, the message starts with `Archived employee:` followed by the employee's details.

If you run `find Alice` and then archive one matching employee, the remaining Alice records stay visible.
If that was the last match, the search remains active with an empty result.

The ID is matched case-insensitively. An unknown ID produces `No employee with ID E0123 was found.` Archiving an
already archived employee produces `Employee with ID E0123 is already archived.` No data changes on either error.

The following input errors apply to both `archive` and `unarchive`. Each error is followed by that command's usage,
and leaves the records, view and undo/redo history unchanged.

| Example input | Error message |
| --- | --- |
| `archive` or `archive 1` | `Missing parameter: id/EMPLOYEE_ID.` |
| `archive id/` | `Employee ID cannot be blank.` |
| `archive id/E0123 date/2026-10-27` | `Unknown parameter: date/. Only id/ is supported.` |
| `archive id/E 123` or `archive id/E0123!` | `Employee ID should be 1 to 20 characters long and contain only letters, digits, hyphens and underscores.` |
| `archive id/E0123 id/E0123` | `Multiple values specified for the following single-valued field(s): id/` |
| `archive extra id/E0123` | `Unexpected arguments. Specify exactly one employee ID using id/EMPLOYEE_ID.` |

Archiving a manager preserves their reporting relationships. If active employees still report directly to that
manager, the success message gives their count and suggests a command to review their assignments, for example:

```text
1 active employee still reports to this archived manager.
Use team id/E0123 to review their assignments.
```

The count excludes archived employees and indirect reports. No notice appears when there are no active direct
reports. Unarchiving the manager or undoing the archive preserves the same reporting relationships.

### Unarchiving employees: `unarchive`

Restores an archived employee to the active roster.
The current list, search or filter and sort order are preserved. A restored employee appears only if they match
that view. When they are outside the view, the success message suggests `list` to see them.

Format: `unarchive id/EMPLOYEE_ID`

Example: `unarchive id/E0123`

The same ID rules and input errors as [`archive`](#archiving-employees-archive) apply. Restoring an employee keeps
their existing ID, other details and reporting relationships, and saves the active status automatically.
The result starts with `Unarchived employee:` followed by their details. If they are outside the current view,
the next line is ``The restored employee is outside the current view. Use `list` to see it.``
Use `undo` or `redo` to reverse or repeat the restoration during the same session.

If you run `list archived` and then `unarchive id/E0123`, the remaining archived records stay visible so you can
continue restoring employees. Restoring the last archived record leaves an empty archive view. Use `list` to view
the restored employees.

An unknown ID produces the usual employee-not-found error. Attempting to unarchive an active employee produces
`Employee with ID E0123 is already active.`

### Listing archived employees: `list archived`

Shows all archived employees in the employee panel, with an `Archived` label on their cards. It replaces any
search, filter or reporting view and resets sorting to stored roster order. Normal `list` shows only active
employees and also resets the view and sorting.

Format: `list archived`

When archived employees exist, the result is `Listed all archived employees.` Otherwise, the panel is empty and
the result is `There are no archived employees.` If `list` finds no active employees but archived records exist,
it suggests `list archived` and gives their count. For example:

```text
There are no active employees. Use `list archived` to see the 2 archived employees.
```

Use lowercase `archived` with no additional arguments. `list Archived`, `list all` and
`list archived id/E0123` are rejected with `Invalid command format.` followed by `Usage: list [archived]`.
Listing does not change employee records or add an undo step.

Undo keeps the current view. For example, after `archive id/E0123`, `list archived`, then `undo`, the restored
employee leaves the archive view. If no other archived employees remain, the panel is empty even though the
message says `Undo successful.` Use `list` to see the restored employee in the active roster.

Archived employees retain their IDs, can be edited with `edit`, and can be deleted with `delete` (and restored with `undo` during the same session).

### Deleting an employee: `delete`

Deletes one employee from the complete roster using their employee ID.

Format: `delete id/EMPLOYEE_ID`

* Employee IDs contain 1 to 20 letters, digits, hyphens or underscores, with no spaces. For example, `E0001`, `EMP-0042`, `2024-017`, `abc` and `e0123` are valid.
* ID matching ignores letter case: `e0123` identifies the same employee as `E0123`. The success message shows the ID as stored.
* Supply exactly one `id/` parameter. Surrounding spaces and tabs are accepted; spaces within an ID, repeated `id/` parameters and other parameters are rejected.
* The command searches all employee records, including archived employees and employees hidden by `find`.
* The current list, search or filter and sort order are preserved, including an archived-only view. Deleting the last matching employee leaves that view empty; use `list` to see all active employees.
* Deleting a manager removes the manager assignment from their direct reports, including archived reports. The success message gives the number affected. Other reporting relationships are preserved.
* Deletion is immediate, with no confirmation. Use `undo` to restore the record and any manager assignments removed by that deletion during the same session. A restored archived employee remains archived. Use `redo` to apply the deletion again.
* The final employee can be deleted, and a deleted ID can be reused. Successful deletions are saved automatically and remain deleted after restarting HuntR; undo history is not retained across restarts.

Examples, assuming the target employee exists:

* `delete id/EMP-0042` deletes employee `EMP-0042`.
* `delete id/e0123` deletes employee `E0123`.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete id/EMP-0042` deletes `EMP-0042` even when hidden by that search. The Betsy search remains active.

On success, the message starts with `Deleted employee:` and includes the deleted employee's ID, name, phone, email, department and role, and their manager's ID if they have one.

If the employee has direct reports, the message also includes their count, for example
`2 direct reports now have no manager.` For exactly one report, it says `1 direct report now has no manager.`
Those employees remain in the roster with their other details unchanged.

The following input errors leave the records unchanged. Each message is followed by the usage block below.

| Input | Error message |
| --- | --- |
| `delete` or `delete 1` | `Missing parameter: id/EMPLOYEE_ID.` |
| `delete id/` or a whitespace-only ID | `Employee ID cannot be blank.` |
| `delete x/value` or `delete id/abc x/value` | `Unknown parameter: x/. Only id/ is supported.` |
| `delete id/abc!` or `delete id/abc def` | `Employee ID should be 1 to 20 characters long and contain only letters, digits, hyphens and underscores.` |
| `delete id/ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU` (21 characters) | `Employee ID should be at most 20 characters long.` |
| `delete id/abc id/abc` | `Multiple values specified for the following single-valued field(s): id/` |
| `delete extra id/abc` | `Unexpected arguments. Specify exactly one employee ID using id/EMPLOYEE_ID.` |

```text
delete: Deletes one employee by employee ID from all stored employee records.
Parameters: id/EMPLOYEE_ID
Employee ID should be 1 to 20 characters long and contain only letters, digits, hyphens and underscores.
Example: delete id/EMP-0042
```

A valid ID that does not exist produces `No employee with ID EMP-0042 was found.` (using the entered ID), without the usage block. No records are changed. This also applies to deleting an employee twice or deleting from an empty roster.

### Sorting employees: `sort`

Sorts the displayed employees by one field, in ascending or descending order.

Format: `sort FIELD [asc|desc]`

* `FIELD` must be one of `id`, `name`, `department` or `role`. It is not case-sensitive, so `Department` also works.
* The order is `asc` (A to Z) or `desc` (Z to A). It is not case-sensitive. If you leave it out, the order is ascending.
* Letter case and accents are ignored, so `Émile` is sorted with the names that start with `E`. A number inside a value is compared by its value, so `E2` comes before `E10`, and `Level 2` comes before `Level 10`; leading zeros do not change this, so `E0002` comes before `E10`. Otherwise text is compared character by character.
* Employees with the same value are always ordered by employee ID from A to Z, also when the order is `desc`.
* Sorting only changes the order in which employees are shown. Your saved data is not changed.
* The sorted order is kept when you use `find` or `filter`, and when you add, edit or delete employees. An employee whose name, department or role is edited moves to the correct position.
* HuntR does not remember the sorted order after you close it. The employees are shown in the order in which they were added.
* Use [`list`](#listing-all-active-employees-list) to show all active employees in the order in which they were added again.

Examples:
* `sort name` shows the employees in alphabetical order of their names.
* `sort department desc` groups the employees by department, from `Sales` back to `Engineering`.
* `sort role asc` sorts the employees by their role, from A to Z.

The following input errors leave the displayed order unchanged. Each message is followed by the usage of the command.

| Input | Error message |
| --- | --- |
| `sort` or `sort name asc desc` | `Invalid command format.` |
| `sort salary` or `sort salary desc` | `Unknown sort field: salary. The field must be one of: id, name, department, role.` |
| `sort name down` | `Unknown sort order: down. The order must be one of: asc, desc.` |

### Clearing active employees: `clear`

Clears the active employee roster from HuntR. Archived employee records are preserved and can still be removed with
`delete`. Manager assignments on archived employees are cleared if their manager is removed by `clear`.

Format: `clear`

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:** There is no confirmation. After `clear`, the empty active roster and unchanged archive are
saved immediately. Use `undo` to restore the active roster during the same session. Clearing an already empty
active roster still succeeds and shows the active view, but creates no history entry.
</box>

### Importing and exporting CSV files: `import`, `export`

Use CSV files to add a batch of employees or open the complete roster in a spreadsheet application.
For a separate JSON snapshot that can replace the roster later, use [`backup`](#backing-up-employee-data-backup)
and [`restore`](#restoring-a-json-backup-restore).

#### File paths for both commands

Format: `import file/FILE_PATH` or `export file/FILE_PATH`

`file/` is a parameter prefix: these examples read `employees.csv` and write `output.csv` directly in the folder
where HuntR runs: `import file/employees.csv`, `export file/output.csv`. The prefix is not part of the filesystem path.

* Supply one non-empty path ending in `.csv` (case-insensitive). Do not surround the path with quotes.
  Spaces are supported without quotes, for example
  `export file/my exports/staff.csv`. Only the leading `file/` is treated as a prefix; the rest is one path,
  so `import file/my file/staff.csv` reads `my file/staff.csv`.
* Paths must be relative to the folder HuntR runs from and remain inside it, including after symbolic links are
  followed. Absolute paths and paths such as `file/../staff.csv` are rejected.
* Positional paths such as `import employees.csv` and `export output.csv` remain supported for compatibility.
  To access a directory literally named `file`, use `import file/file/employees.csv` or `import ./file/employees.csv`.

#### Importing employees: `import`

Format: `import file/FILE_PATH`

Example: `import file/employees.csv`

Save the file as **CSV UTF-8** in Excel or as UTF-8 comma-separated text in a text editor. The first record must
be one of these headers, with the columns in exactly this order. Header names ignore letter case and surrounding
spaces; Excel's UTF-8 byte order mark is accepted. Do not put a blank line before the header.

| Header | How missing fields are handled |
| --- | --- |
| `id,name,phone,email,department,role,archived,managerId` | Current format; all eight values must be present in each employee row, including blank values. |
| `id,name,phone,email,department,role,archived` | Legacy format; every imported employee has no manager. |
| `id,name,phone,email,department,role` | Legacy format; every imported employee is active and has no manager. |

The first six values follow the same [field rules as `add`](#adding-an-employee-add). `archived` accepts `true`,
`false` or blank (meaning `false`), ignoring case and surrounding spaces. A blank `managerId` means no manager;
otherwise it must identify an existing employee or another employee in the same CSV, even one on a later row.
Manager IDs ignore case and are saved using the referenced employee's ID spelling. Self-reporting and cycles are rejected.

For example, save the following as `employees.csv` in the folder where HuntR runs. Both IDs must be unused:

```csv
id,name,phone,email,department,role,archived,managerId
C1002,Mei Lim,81234567,mei.lim@example.com,"Research, Development",Developer,true,C1001
C1001,John Tan,91234567,john.tan@example.com,"Research, Development",Manager,false,
```

The comma in `Research, Development` is part of the department because the field is enclosed in double quotes.
CSV also supports quoted line breaks and doubled double quotes inside quoted fields, but the resulting values
must still satisfy employee field rules. Blank records after the header are skipped.

* Import **adds** employees; it does not replace existing records. IDs must be unique, ignoring case, both within
  the CSV and against the complete active and archived roster. Importing an export into the same roster is therefore rejected.
* HuntR validates the entire file before adding anyone. Invalid fields, duplicate IDs, malformed quotes, incorrect
  column counts or invalid reporting relationships reject the whole import. Empty and header-only files are also rejected.
* On success, HuntR displays `Imported 2 employee(s) from employees.csv` for the example above, saves the change
  automatically and shows all active employees with the current sort order. `C1001` is visible; use `list archived`
  to see `C1002`. Imported records are appended in CSV row order, after the existing records.
* One `undo` reverses the whole import. `redo` restores the imported records without rereading the CSV.
  Failed imports, including automatic-save failures, preserve the previous records, view and undo/redo history.

Common errors:

| Problem | Result and next step |
| --- | --- |
| Missing file, or a path to a directory | `File not found: <path>`. Check the filename and its location. |
| File is not UTF-8 | HuntR asks you to save it as `CSV UTF-8`. Resave the file and try again. |
| Wrong header or column order | HuntR shows the required header. Use one of the three supported headers above. |
| Invalid employee row | `Nothing was imported. Row <number>: <problem>`. Correct the indicated record. The number is its starting physical line, counting the header as line 1, including blank lines and quoted line breaks. |
| Reporting cycle | `Nothing was imported. Reporting relationships cannot contain a cycle.` Correct the manager assignments. |
| File cannot be read | Close it in other programs such as Excel and check read permissions. |

The example import adds two records, with only active employee `C1001` shown in the active view:

![Successful import of the two-record CSV example](images/csv-import-result.jpg)

#### Exporting employees: `export`

Format: `export file/FILE_PATH`

Example: `export file/exports/staff.csv`

* Exports **every active and archived employee**, including employees hidden by the current view, in stored roster
  order. Searching, filtering or sorting the employee cards does not restrict or reorder the exported records.
* Writes UTF-8 CSV using the eight-column header above, preserving archive status and manager IDs.
  Fields containing commas, double quotes or line breaks are quoted automatically.
* Creates missing parent folders. **An existing destination file is replaced immediately, without confirmation.**
  Use a new filename to keep an earlier export.
* Success displays `Exported <count> employee(s) to <path>`. The count includes archived employees.
  An empty roster produces a header-only file, which `import` will reject because it contains no employees.
* Leaves employee data, the current view, sort order and undo/redo history unchanged. `undo` does not remove or
  recover exported files. Export uses an ordinary file write; it does not provide the atomic-save guarantees of JSON data saving.
* If writing fails, HuntR displays `Could not write to <path>. Check that the file is not open in another program
  (such as Excel) and that you are allowed to write to that folder.` Close the file and check permissions before retrying.

Exporting after the example import includes both employees, even though only one is visible:

![Successful export of both active and archived employees](images/csv-export-result.jpg)

### Backing up employee data: `backup`

Saves a separate JSON snapshot of the complete current roster, including archived and hidden employees,
manager assignments, ID spelling and stored record order. It does not back up preferences or session undo/redo history.

Format: `backup`

Example: `backup`

* Takes no parameters. Extra text such as `backup now` or `backup file/copy.json` is rejected with the command usage.
* Creates `data/backups` inside the folder where HuntR runs if needed. The destination is fixed; no custom path is accepted.
* Files are named `huntr-yyyyMMdd-HHmmss-0000000000.json` using the computer's local date and time.
  The ten-digit counter increases when a name is occupied, so earlier snapshots are never overwritten, including
  backups created in the same second. Older backup filenames remain valid.
* Success displays `Backed up <count> employee(s) to <backup-path>`, for example
  `Backed up 2 employee(s) to data/backups/huntr-20261028-183000-0000000000.json`.
  Path separators follow your operating system. The count includes archived employees; an empty roster can also be backed up.
* Leaves records, the current view, sort order and undo/redo history unchanged and does not rewrite the main employee file.
  `undo` does not delete the snapshot. Use [`restore file/JSON_FILE_PATH`](#restoring-a-json-backup-restore) with the
  reported path to load it later; restoration replaces the roster.
* The backup folder must support hard links and the [access protections used for JSON saving](#saving-the-data).
  If saving fails, HuntR displays
  `Could not save the backup to <backup-path>. Check that you are allowed to write to that folder.`
  Unsupported hard links fail without creating an empty final backup file; existing snapshots remain intact.

The result shows the snapshot's actual path; its timestamp and counter will differ for each backup:

![Successful JSON backup showing the generated snapshot path](images/json-backup-result.jpg)

### Undoing and redoing employee changes: `undo`, `redo`

Format: `undo` or `redo`. Use lowercase command words without parameters. Surrounding spaces and tabs are accepted.
Each command moves exactly one history step.

| Input and condition | Exact result |
| --- | --- |
| `undo`, with a preceding state | `Undo successful.` |
| `redo`, with a subsequent state | `Redo successful.` |
| `  undo  `, with a preceding state | `Undo successful.` |
| `undo`, with no preceding state | `No more commands to undo.` |
| `redo`, with no subsequent state | `No more commands to redo.` |

Arguments such as `undo 2` or `undo id/E0123` produce:

```text
Invalid command format.
undo: Reverts the most recent data-changing command.
Parameters: none
Example: undo
```

Arguments such as `redo 2` or `redo now` produce:

```text
Invalid command format.
redo: Reapplies the most recently undone data-changing command.
Parameters: none
Example: redo
```

Syntax is checked before history availability, so these format errors also apply to a new session.
Aliases, step counts and uppercase command words are not supported. For example:

```text
Unknown command: UNDO
Type help to see the available commands.
Did you mean undo? Command words are written in lowercase.
```

Other unrecognised words, such as `u`, `r` and `undo2`, also produce an unknown-command error; HuntR may suggest a
nearby command. A suggestion does not execute that command.
Normal parsing and command errors retain your input and use the command box's existing error styling;
they do not save or change records, history or the view. Successful commands clear the command box.

One history step covers an entire successful `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `clear`, `import`, `restore`, `archive`, `unarchive`,
`manager` or `unassign-manager`.
An import of several employees is reversed by one undo. Redo restores saved data directly, even if the original
CSV has changed or been deleted. A JSON backup restore is also reversed by one undo, and redo does not reread the backup.
All employee values, ID spelling, archive status, manager assignments and stored order are restored,
including employees hidden from the current view. Clear affects only active employees.

Undo and redo preserve the view active immediately before the command: active-only, archived-only or the current
search, even when it matches nobody. Restored employees can remain hidden; use `list` or `list archived` to see them.
A historical search is not restored. The current sort order is also preserved; undo does not reverse a `sort`.
Selection and scroll position are not guaranteed to remain unchanged.

A successful actual employee-data change after undo discards the redo states. An identical edit reports
`No changes made: the new values are the same as the existing ones for EMPLOYEE_ID.` and preserves records, view
and redo without saving. Clearing an already empty active roster still succeeds and resets to the active view,
but creates no history entry and preserves redo. Commands that only change the view or inspect records, such as
`list`, `list archived`, `find`, `filter`, `sort`, `stats` and `check`, create no employee-history step and preserve redo. Failed commands also
preserve redo. Exported and backup files are outside employee history. Header-only imports remain errors.

**Example: undo, redo and a new change**

Launch with the default history setting and ensure `HIST-001` is not already stored. Run these commands in order:

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `add id/HIST-001 n/History Demo p/91234567 e/history@example.com d/QA r/Tester` | Adds the employee as a Tester. |
| `edit id/HIST-001 r/Analyst` | Changes the role to Analyst. |
| `undo` | Restores the role to Tester. |
| `edit id/HIST-001 r/Tester` | Leaves the data unchanged, so redo is still available. |
| `redo` | Restores the role to Analyst. |
| `undo` | Restores the role to Tester again. |
| `edit id/HIST-001 r/Lead` | Changes the role to Lead and discards the Analyst redo state. |
| `redo` | Reports `No more commands to redo.`; the role remains Lead. |

**Session history and its limit**

History is unlimited by default and exists only for this session. To limit retained history, launch HuntR with
`java -Dhuntr.maxUndoHistory=100 -jar huntr.jar`. Put the `-D` option before `-jar` and replace `huntr.jar` with your
actual JAR filename if different.

| Setting | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Omitted, or `-Dhuntr.maxUndoHistory=-1` | Keeps every employee-history step in this session. |
| `-Dhuntr.maxUndoHistory=100` | Keeps up to 100 undo steps. A new data change beyond capacity discards the oldest retained states. |
| `-Dhuntr.maxUndoHistory=0` | Disables undo/redo history. Employee changes still work and are saved automatically. |

For example, with a limit of `2`, three successive data changes leave only the last two changes undoable;
the state before the first change is no longer available. Undo and redo themselves do not evict more states.
The limit counts steps, not employees or bytes, so a large roster can still use substantial memory.
An unchanged edit does not consume capacity. A failed command or failed save restores the previous history,
including any redo states or oldest state tentatively removed by that command.

The setting must be an integer from `-1` to `2147483647`; invalid values prevent startup. Restart to change the limit.
Restarting loads the last successfully saved employee state with no available undo or redo. Exit therefore ends
the opportunity to undo earlier changes, even when history was unlimited.

### Restoring a JSON backup: `restore`

Replaces the entire employee roster, including archived records, with the contents of a JSON backup created by
`backup`. This replaces records rather than merging them. A valid empty backup clears the entire roster.

Format: `restore file/JSON_FILE_PATH`

Example: `restore file/data/backups/huntr-20261020-153005.json`

* Supply exactly one `file/` path ending in `.json`. Paths with spaces and absolute paths are supported.
  Relative paths are resolved from the folder where HuntR runs. Do not surround the path with quotes.
  Only the leading `file/` is a prefix: `restore file/my file/staff.json` reads `my file/staff.json`.
* HuntR reads and validates the complete backup before replacing any records. Employee IDs must be unique,
  all employee fields must be valid, and manager references must exist without self-reporting or reporting cycles.
* Archived status, manager assignments, ID spelling and stored employee order are preserved. Older backups without
  archive status or manager assignments remain supported. After restoration, the active employees are shown with
  the current sort order; use `list archived` to see restored archived records.
* Success displays `Restored <count> employee(s) from <path>` and automatically saves the restored roster.
  Use `undo` to recover the previous roster during the same session. `redo` restores the saved snapshot even if
  the backup file has since changed or been deleted. Restoring identical data creates no history step and preserves redo.
* A missing file displays `Backup file not found: <path>`. An unreadable or invalid backup is rejected without
  changing the roster. Failed restoration or automatic saving preserves the previous records, view and undo/redo history.

### Exiting the program: `exit`

Closes HuntR. Successful employee changes have already been saved. Session undo/redo history is discarded on exit.

Format: `exit`

The command takes no parameters, and extra text such as `exit now` is rejected.

### Saving the data

HuntR automatically saves employee data after successful data-changing commands, including undo/redo and
no-op mutations such as clearing an already empty active roster. Read-only commands such as `list`, `find`,
`help`, `stats`, `check` and `exit` do not rewrite the employee file. Export and backup write only their requested
output files. You do not need to save manually. History and view filters are never written to JSON.

HuntR writes the complete JSON to a protected temporary file beside the data file, then replaces the data file
atomically. If a handled failure occurs before replacement, the last stored file keeps its original bytes. If no
data file existed, it remains absent. Newly created folders may remain. Successful replacement completes the save.

If a data-changing command (including undo or redo) fails during execution or automatic saving, HuntR restores
its previous in-memory employee data, complete history and current view. A failed change after undo preserves
the original redo sequence. A failed no-op also restores the previous view and preserves redo.

Use HuntR as a single-user application on a local filesystem that supports atomic replacement and the required
access protections. New files are private to their creator: owner read/write (`0600`) on POSIX systems, or an
owner-only access ACL granting full file access on Windows. Existing files retain their nine POSIX permission bits
or supported Windows access ACL, provided their owner (and POSIX group) matches the newly created file's owner/group.
Read-only files are rejected; HuntR does not clear protection or change ownership to allow a save. Other filesystem
metadata is not promised to be preserved. See the [Developer Guide](DeveloperGuide.md#storage-component) for the
precise supported policy.

Configured paths stay unchanged. Valid symbolic links are retained and their real targets are saved; dangling
links and directory destinations are rejected. Do not run concurrent writers or edit the file while HuntR is open.

An automatic-save failure is displayed instead of the command's success result:

```text
Could not save data due to the following error: <exception-message>
```

For unsupported atomic replacement, the exact message is:

```text
Could not save data due to the following error: Atomic replacement is not supported for this data file.
```

If the required access protections cannot be established or preserved, it is:

```text
Could not save data due to the following error: Cannot preserve the required file access protections.
```

Access-denied failures use:

```text
Could not save data to file <exception-message> due to insufficient permissions to write to the file or the folder.
```

Here, `<exception-message>` is the filesystem exception's message. It may include paths and additional diagnostic
text, rather than just the configured destination path. These normal errors retain the command text and existing
error styling. Unexpected runtime failures also restore in-memory state for data-changing commands, but the
existing UI does not provide ordinary command-box handling for those exceptions.

Read-only commands do not attempt an automatic employee-file save, so an unwritable employee file does not prevent
view changes, searches or help. Export and backup still require write access to their own output destinations.

Use [`backup`](#backing-up-employee-data-backup) to save a separate JSON snapshot. It uses its own backup-specific
error message and never overwrites an existing snapshot. CSV exports use an ordinary file write rather than this
atomic JSON-saving mechanism.

### Editing the data file

HuntR data is saved automatically as a JSON file `data/addressbook.json` in the folder where HuntR runs, which is the
folder you `cd` to in the [Quick start](#quick-start) (not necessarily the folder that contains the JAR file). Advanced
users may update that file in a text editor while HuntR is closed.

Each employee in the `employees` array has an `archived` status. Employee IDs remain unique regardless of status.
Older valid files without the `archived` field continue to load, with those employees treated as active.
The optional `managerId` field stores the direct manager's ID. Missing or null `managerId` means no manager.
Manager IDs must refer to an existing employee, with no self-reporting or cycles. Invalid relationships cause the
whole file to be rejected.

**Caution:**
If your changes make the data file invalid, HuntR rejects the whole file (it does not load only the valid employees) and starts with an empty employee list at the next run. Before your next successful data-changing command overwrites the invalid file, HuntR keeps a copy of it as `data/unreadable-addressbook.json` (replacing any earlier copy) and shows a warning in the result box. To restore your employees, close HuntR, fix the copy and use it to replace `data/addressbook.json`. If the copy cannot be made, the warning asks you to close HuntR and back up the file yourself. Even so, always back up the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause HuntR to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app on the other computer, run it, and exit. Create the `data` folder in the folder where you run HuntR if it does not exist. Then overwrite that data file (`data/addressbook.json`) with the data file from your previous HuntR home folder.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **Pasting commands containing tabs:** The command box removes pasted tab characters, which can join words or parameters and cause the command to fail. Replace tabs with ordinary spaces before pasting a command. Pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> to complete command words still works.
4. **Symbol-only filter values:** An `n/`, `d/` or `r/` value containing only `&`, apostrophes or certain standalone combining marks can be accepted even though it has no letter or digit. For example, `filter d/&` may show an empty list instead of the documented validation error. Include at least one letter or digit in each value. If an accidental symbol-only filter changes the displayed list, use `list` to show all active employees again. Employee records and undo/redo history are unchanged.
